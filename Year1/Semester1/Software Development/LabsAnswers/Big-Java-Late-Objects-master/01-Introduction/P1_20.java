/*
To speak more than one language is a valuable skill in the labor market today. One of
the basic skills is learning to greet people. Write a program that prints a two-column
list with the greeting phrases shown in the following table; in the first column, print
the phrase in English, in the second column, print the phrase in a language of your
choice. If you don’t speak any language other than English, use an online translator
or ask a friend.
