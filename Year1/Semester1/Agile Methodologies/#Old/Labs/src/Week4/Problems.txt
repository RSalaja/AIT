Problem 1:
Design, implement and test an application that calculates the cost per 100 kilometers of running a car and 
how far a car can go with a full tank of petrol based on the following information being provided:
1. The number of litres of petrol in the tank.
2. The fuel efficiency in kilometers per litre.
3. The price of petrol per litre.

Problem 2:
Design, implement and test an application that reads two times in military format (0900, 1730) and calculates
the number of hours and minutes between the two times.

Employ:
1. Simplified software development process (employed in last week's practical).

(litres/fuel efficiency) * price

(cost per 100 kilometers/litres) * price
