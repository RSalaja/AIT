					As summer ends and autumn comes, the days get shorter and shorter. This is how the trees "know" to
					begin getting ready for winter. During winter, there is not enough light or water for
					photosynthesis. The trees will rest, and live off the food they stored during the summer. They begin
					to shut down their food-making factories. The green chlorophyll disappears from the leaves. As the
					bright green fades away, we begin to see yellow and orange colors. Small amounts of these colors
					have been in the leaves all along. We just can't see them in the summer, because they are covered up
					by the green chlorophyll. The bright reds and purples we see in leaves are made mostly in the fall.
					In some trees, like maples, glucose is trapped in the leaves after photosynthesis stops. Sunlight
					and the cool nights of autumn cause the online slots leaves turn this glucose into a red color. The
					brown color of trees like oaks is made from wastes left in the leaves. It is the combination of all
					these things that make the beautiful fall foliage colors we enjoy each year.
