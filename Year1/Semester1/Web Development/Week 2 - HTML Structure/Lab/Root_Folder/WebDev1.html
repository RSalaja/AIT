		<h4><b>HTML:</b></h4>

			 understanding of how webpages are put together</p>
		<h4><b>XML:</b></h4>
		<p>Extnsible Markup Language(XML) is a markup language 
			that defines a set of ruels for encoding documents in a 
			format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. 
			It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification[4] produced by the W3C.</p>
		<h4><b>Javascript:</b></h4>
		<p>JavaScript is the most popular scripting language 
			in the world. It is the standard language used in 
			web pages, but it is also widely used by desktop apps, 
			mobile phone apps, and internet services</p>
