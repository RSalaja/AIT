                Pathfinder is the picture of optimism, despite his circumstances. A MRVN (Mobile Robotic Versatile
                eNtity) modified to specialize in location scouting and surveying, he booted up decades ago in an
                abandoned laboratory with no idea who created him or why. With only his MRVN designation to hint at his
                identity, Pathfinder set off in search of his creator.
                <br><br>
                Pathfinder has learned much in his travels since then (like how to make a mean Eastern Leviathan Stew)
                but hasn't come any closer to finding his creator. Still, he's never given up hope, and took odd jobs in
                order to gain information about his maker. It was during a chance meeting with bartender Elliott Witt in
                Solace City that he learned about the Apex Games. Wishing to gain a following—and hopefully draw the
                attention of his maker, he joined the popular bloodsport. In the meantime, he remains enthusiastic and
                helpful, always ready to make new friends (then shoot them).</p>

                        Pathfinder is a Support Legend very useful on movement and rotation. His Grappling Hook.png Grappling Hook ability allows you to reach higher places and to tactically reposition while his Insider Knowledge.png Insider Knowledge and Zipline Gun.png Zipline Gun abilities allow him to support your squad by letting them know the position of the next ring and provide a zipline on-the-fly to allow quick escapes and to reposition respectively.
