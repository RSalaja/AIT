                Alexander Maxwell Nox was born to Arthur Rutherford Nox and Katerina Ticacek Nox on February 25,
                2685. He worked as a research scientist for Humbert Labs on his homeworld Gaea, the Frontier's
                leading manufacturer of pesticide gases. With a glut of pesticides needed to protect the growing
                Frontier coloniesâ€™ crops, Humbert Labs was constantly on the hunt for better and stronger formulas. Nox
                was one of their brightest scientists and worked day and night developing new gases. But to make sure
                they worked, he needed to test them on more than just inert tissue: he needed something living.
                <br><br>
                As he toiled in secret, Nox began to see the beauty in his creations and their ability to destroy
                anything they touched. But the head of Humbert Labs, Dr. Franklin Humbert, soon discovered his gruesome
                experiments, and their confrontation ended with the lab in flames and its chief dead. Today, Nox is
                missing and presumed deceased, his supposed body found and identified by his mother, charred and beyond
                recognition. 10 years later, Caustic now finds new test subjects in the Apex Games, where he puts his
                gaseous creations to work and observes their effects with great interest.</p>

                    Caustic is a Defensive Legend with a slower play style, he excels in holding down the fort and
                    breaking down enemy attacks. His gas traps, gas grenades, and Nox vision can cause breaks in enemy
                    attacks, distorting vision and causing panic.
