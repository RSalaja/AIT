                Natalie Paquette is a familiar face in the Apex Games, though for a different reason than most. Daughter
                of the Games’ lead electrical engineer Luc Paquette, she studied his manuals to stay close to him, and
                discovered her calling at a young age. Though she could be completely distracted one moment and
                hyper-focused the next, electricity grounded her – its ordered, predictable flow made sense in a way the
                rest of the world didn’t.
                <br><br>
                She devoured every book she could on the subject, and eventually became such a skilled engineer that she
                was commissioned by the Syndicate to build the Apex Games’ Modified Containment Ring. Unfortunately, her
                father died the day it was revealed, leaving her alone. At her lowest moment, a group of competitors
                invited her to return to the arena with them, assuring her she would always have a home. She now fights
                alongside her friends in the arena she helped build, destroying incoming missiles, recharging shields,
                creating fences, and using her pylon to silence fights that get too loud. Nobody knows the arena better
                than Wattson – anyone who underestimates her is in for a shock.

                        Another Defensive Legend with a slower play style, Wattson is a great defender of anything. Her Pylons not only slow but damage enemies dumb enough to storm your location. With her Spark of Genius, which fully recharged her ult with any Ultimate Accelerant, will give you her Ultimate faster than any other legend. And when it is charged and ready, her Ultimate will stop all grenades, missiles, or anything else throwable from breaking into your base.
