                One day, Octavio Silva was bored. In fact, he was bored most days. Heir to the preoccupied CEOs of Silva
                Pharmaceuticals and wanting for nothing in life, he entertained himself by performing death-defying
                stunts and posting holovids of them for his fans to gawk over. So, this day, he decided to set the
                course record for a nearby Gauntlet by launching himself across the finish line – using a grenade. He
                later recounted that day as the single greatest day in his life.
                <br><br>
                As he lay in triage hours later, the doctors informed him that the damage done to his legs meant his
                daredevil days were over. That didn’t sit well with Octavio, who turned to an old friend for help: Ajay
                Che, who he guilted into forging an order to replace his legs with bionic ones. Suddenly able to repair
                his limbs at a moment’s notice, Octavio decided petty online stunts weren’t enough: the ultimate
                adrenaline rush, the Apex Games, was calling. Now, he’s going to become an Apex Champion doing the most
                incredible, death-defying moves anyone’s ever seen. Maybe in the arena, he won’t be so bored.</p>

                        Octane is a high-speed Offensive Legend as the name implies. His Stim.png Stim is great for closing in on opponents and covering large distances. His passive Swift Mend.png Swift Mend and ultimate Launch Pad.png Launch Pad complements it by providing self-healing and a jump pad to cover more and vertical distances.
