                Once a simple settlement on the planet Solace dating back to the earliest expeditions to the Frontier,
                the island known as Kings Canyon, didn't thrive until a century later, when the now-defunct IMC built
                several outposts centered around scientific research and development. In fact, it's rumored that the IMC
                conducted experiments using phase shift technology here, although explorers have yet to find any
                evidence that proves this. To blow off steam, IMC soldiers station here would compete in gladiator-esque
                combat in an area they nicknamed 'Thunderdome'. Years later, when the Syndicate commissioned the
                rebuilding of the island of Kings Canyon as the home of their newest bloodsport, they insisted
                Thunderdome remain untouched - a tribute to the earliest known predecessor of what we know today as 'The
                Apex Games'
                <br><br>
                An EMP detonated by a mysterious figure in the Repulsor Tower allowed the nearby Flyers and Leviathans
                to invade the island. The Leviathans made their home in the river and caused the destruction of the
                settlements on it. The Legends were evacuated and the games put on-hold due to the attack. This respite
                allowed the Syndicate to add new areas to the map, including a huge structure near the destroyed Bridges
                and Hydro Dam called The Cage and a camp near what was once Cascades called Containment.</p>
