                Crypto specializes in secrets; he knows how to uncover them, and how to keep them. A brilliant hacker
                and encryption expert, he uses aerial drones to spy on his opponents in the Apex Arena without being
                seen. Itâ€™s been noted that his drones have a similar design to those created by wanted murderer Tae Joon
                Park.
                <br><br>
                Orphans raised on the streets of Suotamo, Tae Joon and his foster sister Mila Alexander escaped a life
                of squalor by becoming computer engineers, designing drones that transmit the Apex Games throughout the
                Outlands. But one day, Tae Joon disappeared with an important company secret, and his sister vanished
                under mysterious and violent circumstances.
                <br><br>
                The truth however is that a program they accidentally discovered, a prediction algorithm for the Apex
                Games that can be used to game the betting systems and gain them a ton of money, was what led to the
                tragic events surrounding Mila's disappearance and Tae Joon's framing for murder. On the run from the
                Syndicate, he gave up his identity, his face and his family in order to facilitate his redemption. He is
                now Crypto and in the games, he now seeks justice
                <br><br>
                His first move in his redemption plan was blowing up the Repulsor Tower using an EMP blast, allowing
                the entry of hostile wildlife on Kings Canyon and disrupting the games.

                        A Recon Legend, Crypto takes to the skies with his Surveillance Drone, revealing enemies for both Crypto and his teammates, thanks to Neural Link. And if he finds that the enemies have already hunkered down, he can activate his Drone EMP to break their defenses and slow them, before he comes out of the shadows and makes his move with his squad.
