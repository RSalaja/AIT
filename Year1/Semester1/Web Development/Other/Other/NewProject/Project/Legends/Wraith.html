                Subject 611367, Codenamed "Wraith", is a whirlwind fighter, able to execute swift and deadly attacks and
                manipulate spacetime by opening rifts in the fabric of reality. Years ago, she woke up in an IMC
                Detention Facility for the Mentally Ill with no memory of her life before. She also began hearing a
                distant voice whispering in her mind that would keep her awake for days on end, nearly driving her
                insane.
                <br><br>
                She was on the facility one day when a portal opened before she was to be sedated. A person wearing a
                purple helmet comes out and scares the facility staff away. The person berated her for not fighting back
                and revealed herself to her. She was her from another dimension, on a quest for revenge on the people
                who experimented on her. With this Voidwalker's help, she learned to trust the voices and was given the
                device needed for her to safely manipulate the void.
                <br><br>
                Using a portal to the Voidwalker's dimension enabled her to escape her facility, arriving in Kings
                Canyon still under construction for the Apex Games. Determined to uncover her true identity, Wraith
                began a quest to find out more about the experiments and herself. Many of the old research facilities,
                however, are buried beneath the heavily guarded arenas used for the Apex Games. She now returns from
                where she arrived on this world and joined the competition, and with every match she gets closer to the
                truth.
