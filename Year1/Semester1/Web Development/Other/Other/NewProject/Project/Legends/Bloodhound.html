                Bloodhound is known across the Outlands as one of the greatest game hunters the Frontier has ever seen â€“
                and that's about all anyone knows.
                Their identity is a mystery wrapped in layers of rumors: they are fabulously wealthy, a bloodthirsty
                murderer, a Goliath whisperer, a former slave, half bat, and a dozen other things depending on who's
                doing the whispering.
                <br><br>
                All anyone truly knows is that Bloodhound is a force to be reckoned with in the Apex Games, having won
                four championships in a row. Bloodhound's unparalleled tracking skills are a boon to any team they join,
                helping them root out hidden opponents and tracking the enemy's movements. Calling on Earth's Old Norse
                Gods to guide them, Bloodhound believes that destiny is a path that has already been laid out,
                eventually carrying all to their death. But with that knowledge comes strength, because until that day
                comes, Bloodhound knows they can't be stopped..
