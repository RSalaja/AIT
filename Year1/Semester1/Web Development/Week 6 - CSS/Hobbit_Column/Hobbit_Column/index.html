			<h1>The Song Of The Lonely Mountain</h1>
			<hr><p>
				Far over the misty mountains cold<br>
				To dungeons deep and caverns old<br>
				We must away ere break of day<br>
				To seek the pale enchanted gold.<br>
			</p>
			<p>				
				The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,<br>
				While hammers fell like ringing bells<br>
				In places deep, where dark things sleep,<br>
				In hollow halls beneath the fells.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				For ancient king and elvish lord<br>
				There many a gleaming golden hoard<br>
				They shaped and wrought, and light they caught<br>
				To hide in gems on hilt of sword.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				On silver necklaces they strung<br>
				The flowering stars, on crowns they hung<br>
				The dragon-fire, in twisted wire<br>
				They meshed the light of moon and sun.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Far over the misty mountains cold<br>
				To dungeons deep and caverns old<br>
				We must away, ere break of day,<br>
				To claim our long-forgotten gold.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Goblets they carved there for themselves<br>
				And harps of gold; where no man delves<br>
				There lay they long, and many a song<br>
				Was sung unheard by men or elves.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The pines were roaring on the height,<br>
				The winds were moaning in the night.<br>
				The fire was red, it flaming spread;<br>
				The trees like torches blazed with light.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The bells were ringing in the dale<br>
				And men they looked up with faces pale;<br>
				The dragon's ire more fierce than fire<br>
				Laid low their towers and houses frail.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				The mountain smoked beneath the moon;<br>
				The dwarves they heard the tramp of doom.<br>
				They fled their hall to dying fall<br>
				Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Far over the misty mountains grim<br>
				To dungeons deep and caverns dim<br>
				We must away, ere break of day,<br>
				To win our harps and gold from him!<br><hr>
