                The Apex Games are a televised blood sport hosted in the Outlands and ran by the mysterious
                Syndicate
                that attracts Legends from all across the Frontier with promises of money, fame, and glory.
                The Apex Games have been running for more than 120 seasons (the earlier seasons were reported to be
                held
                in the Thunderdome of Kings Canyon). The 124th Season of the games was notable for the inclusion of
                Silva Pharmaceutical's daredevil heir Octavio Silva and the daughter of the Game's lead electrical
                engineer, Natalie Paquette.
                The games was suspended for a long period after a mysterious figure detonated an EMP blast on the
                main
                arena of Kings Canyon's Repulsor Tower. This led to the invasion of wildlife into the arena and the
                temporary suspension of the games. The Syndicate has used this setback to upgrade the arena with new
                structures, including a tall maze-like tower called The Cage and a sponsored area of the arena for
                the
                legend Octane. While initially successful, more attacks from the mysterious figure have made
                reconstructing Kings Canyon more effort than it's worth. It was then decided that the games be moved
                to
                another arena at World's Edge on the planet of Talos.</p>

                                    Once a simple settlement on the planet Solace dating back to the earliest
                                    expeditions to
                                    the
                                    Frontier,
                                    the island known as Kings Canyon, didn't thrive until a century later, when the
                                    now-defunct
                                    IMC built
                                    several outposts centered around scientific research and development. In fact, it's
                                    rumored
                                    that the IMC
                                    conducted experiments using phase shift technology here, although explorers have yet
                                    to
                                    find
                                    any
                                    evidence that proves this. To blow off steam, IMC soldiers station here would
                                    compete in
                                    gladiator-esque
                                    combat in an area they nicknamed 'Thunderdome'. Years later, when the Syndicate
                                    commissioned
                                    the
                                    rebuilding of the island of Kings Canyon as the home of their newest bloodsport,
                                    they
                                    insisted
                                    Thunderdome remain untouched - a tribute to the earliest known predecessor of what
                                    we

                                    An EMP detonated by a mysterious figure in the Repulsor Tower allowed the nearby
                                    Flyers
                                    and
                                    Leviathans
                                    to invade the island. The Leviathans made their home in the river and caused the
                                    destruction
                                    of the
                                    settlements on it. The Legends were evacuated and the games put on-hold due to the
                                    attack.
                                    This respite
                                    allowed the Syndicate to add new areas to the map, including a huge structure near
                                    the
                                    destroyed Bridges

                                    The once uninhabitable world of Talos became a hotbed of IMC activity when a rare
                                    mineral
                                    compound was
                                    discovered beneath its surface. Heat-reducing towers were built to super-cool its
                                    natural
                                    lava flows,
                                    and the town of World’s Edge grew around them. Decades ago, an explosion in one of
                                    the
                                    towers covered
                                    the surrounding area in a lethal flash freeze. Today, World’s Edge is deserted, its
                                    borders
                                    inhabited by
                                    a small community of hunters who reportedly spurn modern technology.

                                    After the Repulsor attack on King's Canyon and the various attempts to rebuild it
                                    proved
                                    too
