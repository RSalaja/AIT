                Gibraltar is a gentle giant with a wild side. The son of two S.A.R.A.S. (Search and Rescue Association
                of Solace) volunteers, he has always been skilled at getting others out of dangerous situations that are
                common in the Outlands. However, he only began to understand the value of protecting others when he and
                his boyfriend stole his father's motorcycle, took it on a joyride, and got trapped by a deadly mudslide.
                His parents saved them, and his father lost an arm in the process. Gibraltar has never forgotten that
                sacrifice and has devoted his life to helping those in need.
                <br><br>
                The Apex Games didn't change that, but they changed what it meant. Many of Gibraltar's friends and
                colleagues have competed in the Games for extra money, fame, and glory over the years, and some never
                came home. Gibraltar joined to keep them safe and, for the first time, his skills as a rescuer and his
                rebellious nature worked together. He's now become an icon in the Apex Games, putting himself in the
                line of fire to protect his squad and send his opponents running for cover.
