                Ajay Che isn't someone you would expect to find in the Apex Games. Once the child of wealthy war
                profiteers, she left home when she learned of the damage her family had caused and enlisted in the
                Frontier Corps, a humanitarian organization that aids Frontier communities in need. She's since devoted
                her life to helping others and joined the Apex Games to fund the Frontier Corps with her winnings.
                <br><br>
                Since no one in the Games is innocent — they all know what they signed up for — and every one of her
                victories means help for those in need, Lifeline has no problem engaging in the popular bloodsport. Or
                so she tells herself. She may seem sarcastic and callous, but deep down she wants to help people and
                make the world a better place. If that means taking a few people down in the process, so be it.

                    A Support Legend with healing abilities, Lifeline is a Legend best for keeping her team alive and up in a firefight. Her D.O.C. Heal Drone.png D.O.C. Heal Drone is great for keeping allies alive or quickly healing them after a fight. Her Combat Medic.png Combat Medic passive allows her to quickly revive teammates behind an indestructible cover, this also allows her to use healing items faster. Lastly, when her ultimate is ready, she can call in helpful Gear with her fan-favorite Care Package.png Care Package
