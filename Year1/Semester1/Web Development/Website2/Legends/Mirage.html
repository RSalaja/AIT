                Mirage is the kind of guy who likes to stand out. The youngest of four brothers, he perfected the art of
                fooling around to get attention. The one thing he took seriously was Holo-Pilot technology: introduced
                to the illusion-creating tech by his engineer mother, he pored over the mechanisms and learned all he
                could about them. Even when his brothers went missing during the Frontier War, Mirage and his mother
                continued to develop holo devices, and the work brought them closer.
                <br><br>
                While working as a bartender on the Paradise Lounge in Solace City[1] to make some extra money, Mirage
                heard amazing stories from his patrons about the Apex Games and the wealth and glory that came with
                victory. As good as both of those sounded, he knew he couldn't risk leaving his mother childless â€“ until
                she gave him a set of customized holo devices and told him to follow his dream. Mirage is now the life
                of the Apex Games, outwitting opponents and charming audiences across the Outlands.

                        Mirage is a more difficult Offensive Legend to play, but is useful for distraction and revealing. His Decoys can confuse enemies, and, when they shoot them, reveals to Mirage the exact position of the enemy. His Ultimate drops a lot of decoys and makes him invisible, letting him confuse enemies, ping them for his team, and then outflank and outlive the enemy. If Mirage gets in over his head and gets knocked down,he just turns invisible to ping the enemy and wait for his team to revive to continue his job.
