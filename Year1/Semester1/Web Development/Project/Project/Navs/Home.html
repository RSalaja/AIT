                The Apex Games are a televised blood sport hosted in the Outlands and ran by the mysterious Syndicate
                that attracts Legends from all across the Frontier with promises of money, fame, and glory.
                <br><br>
                The Apex Games have been running for more than 120 seasons (the earlier seasons were reported to be held
                in the Thunderdome of Kings Canyon). The 124th Season of the games was notable for the inclusion of
                Silva Pharmaceutical's daredevil heir Octavio Silva and the daughter of the Game's lead electrical
                engineer, Natalie Paquette.
                <br><br>
                The games was suspended for a long period after a mysterious figure detonated an EMP blast on the main
                arena of Kings Canyon's Repulsor Tower. This led to the invasion of wildlife into the arena and the
                temporary suspension of the games. The Syndicate has used this setback to upgrade the arena with new
                structures, including a tall maze-like tower called The Cage and a sponsored area of the arena for the
                legend Octane. While initially successful, more attacks from the mysterious figure have made
                reconstructing Kings Canyon more effort than it's worth. It was then decided that the games be moved to
                another arena at World's Edge on the planet of Talos.
