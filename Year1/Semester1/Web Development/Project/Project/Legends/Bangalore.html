                Born into a military family where she, her parents, and her four older
                brothers all served in the IMC Armed Forces, 40138416, callsign Bangalore,
                has been an exceptional soldier since she was young. She was
                top of her class at the IMC Military Academy and the only cadet who
                could take apart a Peacekeeper,equip it with a Precision Choke hop-up,
                and put it back together in under twenty seconds â€“ blindfolded.
                <br><br>
                Three years ago, Anita and her brother Jackson were ordered to retrieve a
                mercenary fleet from the Outlands to aid in the IMC's fight against the Frontier Militia.
                However, their unit lost contact with IMC HQ and were ambushed on arrival.
                The squad scattered, but Jackson stayed behind to give his sister time to escape.
                Alone and with no way home, Anita put her training, extensive weapon knowledge, and
                competitive spirit to work by joining the Apex Games. Now, she fights to raise money
                for passage back to the IMC home base, where she hopes to reunite with
                what remains of her family.</p>

                    Bangalore is an Offensive Legend great with any play style. Her Smoke
                    Launcher is great at breaking line-of-sight by deploying a smoke screen that can then be
                    used to retreat or double-down on an attack. Her passive Double Time gives
                    her a speed boost when shot at while her ultimate, Rolling Thunder.png Rolling Thunder
                    provides her with area denial capabilities
